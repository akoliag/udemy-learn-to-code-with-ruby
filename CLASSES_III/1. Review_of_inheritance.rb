What is inheritance?
- Inheritance is a way for a class to obtain all methods from another class.
- inheritance avoids duplicate code across multiple classes.
- The class inherited from is called the superclass or parent class.
- The class that inherits is called the subclass or child class.
- Ruby only supports single inheritance. A class can only inherit from one
 other class.
- The subclass is a type of the superclass. This is called an "is-a" relationship.
- The relationship does not apply in reverse.
- Thus, the subclass can be called as subset of the superclass.
- A Car is a Vehicle but Vehicle is not guaranteed to be a Car.
- Subclasses are followed by a < symbol and the name of the superclass.
