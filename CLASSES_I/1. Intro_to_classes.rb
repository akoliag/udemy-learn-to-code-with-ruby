INTRO TO CLASSES:
 - Classes are templates for creating objects
Why do we need classes?
 - Ruby's built objects like Arrays or Hashes cannot represent everything
 - What if we need to represent Users or Cars or Invoices?
 - The goal of object-oriented design is to use code to model real-life
  things as classes.
 - An object is a custom container for data. It is made from a class.
 - Objects group functionalities into a single unit.

 OBJECT ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS:
 - Instance variables (attributes) are variables that belong to the object.
 - Attributes provide information about the object's current state.
 - Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object.
 - Encapsulation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object.

 CLASSES AND OBJECTS:
 - A class is a blueprint, pattern, template or outline for an object.
 - An object is an instance of the class. It is created from the class.
 - Instantiation is the process of creating an object from a class.
 - A class is called an abstract type because it hides the complexity of
  interacting with the data, much like a method abstracts the complexity
  of a process.
